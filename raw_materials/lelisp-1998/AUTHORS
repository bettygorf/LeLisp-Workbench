Le-Lisp was developed in 1980 by a team led by Jerôme Chailloux at
INRIA, the French national computer science research laboratory. It
was developed as a direct result of the need for a small, portable,
efficient language for a VLSI design system. It ran on most major
computer systems including SunOS, Solaris, Mac II, Apollo, Decstation,
Vax, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Bull, PS/2, and of course major 386
systems (Windows, Solaris, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD). It was marketed by several
companies throughout Europe, including ILOG, Bull, the Sema Group and
Eligis. Its technical evolution was assured by ILOG and INRIA until
2000 and by Eligis until 2020.

Many commercial products have been built on top of Le-Lisp.
