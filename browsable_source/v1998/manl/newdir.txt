NEWDIR(L)                LOCAL COMMANDS                 NEWDIR(L)



NAME
     newdir - updates absolute path names in the LeLisp system

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/local/lelisp/vax/newdir [path]

DESCRIPTION
     Updates the absolute path names  defined  in  the  following
     files    of    the    standard   distribution   of   LeLisp:
     llib/startup.ll, <machine>/complice, <machine>/config.

     This command should be called from the  <machine>  directory
     of  the standard distribution of LeLisp.  This directory has
     the same name as the machine in use, such as vaxunix,  sony,
     sun,  etc.  The option _p_a_t_h makes it possible to install the
     software in a directory other than the one indicated by  the
     command _p_w_d. This _p_a_t_h should be an absolute path name up to
     the <machine> subdirectory of the  LeLisp  directory.   This
     feature is particularly useful during an installation across
     symbolic links.

     It is necessary to use the command once and  only  once  for
     every  installation  of LeLisp in a new directory other than
     that  specified  in  the  installation  guide  (by  default,
     "/usr/ilog/lelisp/").

     This command requires write access to the files that must be
     updated.
