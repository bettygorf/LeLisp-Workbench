   Other Files:
      Makefile		- Compiles source code, creates test program

In order to build or modify the current version of the package, the
following commands are provided:
	make vax	- to use vax assembly code
	make 68K	- to use 68020 assembly code
	make ns		- to use NS assembly code
	make mips	- to use mips assembly code
	make pyramid	- to use pyramid assembly code
	make C16	- to use C code with 16 bits digits
	make C32	- to use C code with 32 bits digits (default version)

One of these commands products the following files:
	BigNum.a	- BigNum library
	testKerN	- Test program executable for KerN
	bztest		- Test program executable for BigZ

If you have the tools LaTeX, makeindex and aptex, type:
	make doc	- to build the Postscript files of the documents
