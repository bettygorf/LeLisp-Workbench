NAME
     config - builds a LeLisp memory image.

SYNOPSIS
     lelisp/<machine>/config  name  bin  conf  [llcore   [<sizes-
     lelispbin>]]

DESCRIPTION
     Builds the memory image and the shell script to start a LeL-
     isp system with the name _n_a_m_e.


     _b_i_n  is the name of the LeLisp binary to use.  Usually, this
          name  is _l_e_l_i_s_p_b_i_n. Sometimes binaries using the LeLisp
          interpreter and programs in  C  or  Fortran  are  used.
          This  command makes it possible to build a memory image
          containing programs defined as _e_x_t_e_r_n_a_l _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s  from
          the  LeLisp  interpreter.   (For  more details, see the
          LeLisp Reference Manual, Chapter 14,  and  the  command
          _l_e_l_i_s_p(_l)).

     _c_o_n_f is a LeLisp file that describes the construction of the
          memory  image.   The  standard  configuration files are
          usually in the subdirectory _c_o_n_f, a subdirectory of the
          <machine> directory.

     _l_l_c_o_r_e
          is an option that influences only the generation of the
          start  up  command  for the LeLisp system that is being
          built.  If this option is omitted, then the  core  must
          be  located in the directory lelisp/<machine>/llcore to
          be consistent with the start up command of  the  memory
          image  being  built.  However, if during configuration,
          you decide to locate it elsewhere, then  you  must  use
          this  option  to  specify the absolute path name of the
          directory where the core is located in order to be con-
          sistent with the start up command.

          _C_o_n_f_i_g starts up the binary _l_e_l_i_s_p_b_i_n  which  first  of
          all  reads  the  file _s_t_a_r_t_u_p._l_l in the LeLisp library,
          then evaluates the Lisp forms in  the  file  _c_o_n_f.  The
          evaluation  of these forms should create a memory image
          with the name _n_a_m_e._c_o_r_e usually  located  in  the  sub-
          directory  _l_l_c_o_r_e of the <machine> directory.  See also
          the option _l_l_c_o_r_e.
          During the evaluation of the file _c_o_n_f the global  Lisp
          variable #:SYSTEM:NAME has the value of the Lisp symbol
          _n_a_m_e. This makes it possible to use the same configura-
          tion  file  to  build systems with different names (for
          example, systems with different size zones).

          _C_o_n_f_i_g then creates a shell script with the  name  _n_a_m_e

          that makes it possible to start up the binary _l_e_l_i_s_p_b_i_n
          to restore the memory image built this way.

          Optionally, you can give arguments  that  describe  the
          size  of the different memory zones of the interpreter.
          These arguments are passed as such to _l_e_l_i_s_p_b_i_n.


EXAMPLE
     To build a system with the name _l_e_l_i_s_p with the binary  _l_e_l_-
     _i_s_p_b_i_n,  the standard configuration file _L_e_l_i_s_p_c_o_n_f._l_l and a
     code zone of 400 kbytes.
     cd lelisp/<machine>
     ./config lelisp lelispbin Lelispconf.ll -code 400

     The file _L_e_l_i_s_p_c_o_n_f._l_l contains the following Lisp forms :
     (progn
       (load-stm #:system:name t t t t t)
       (add-feature (if (eq 0.0 0.0)
                        '31BITFLOATS
                      '64BITFLOATS))
       )
